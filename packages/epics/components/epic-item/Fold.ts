/****************
 * ### `Fold`
 * The open / folded state of a box an `<epic-*>` element folds by itself, never written to the file:  Choices, an
 * answered question's option panels, More Details, Original Discussion.  (`<epic-item>` folds through its `open`
 * attribute instead:  links and P9 open it from outside.)
 * - Starts as `initial()` says, and follows it until the reader toggles it:  an option panel opens while its option
 *   is the chosen one.
 * - The content box takes `hidden()` and `watch` as its ref:  folded, it's `hidden="until-found"`, so find-in-page
 *   reaches the text and unfolds it (`beforematch`).
